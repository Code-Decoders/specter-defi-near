### `Project Overview:`
Just like conventional peer–to–peer lending and borrowing platforms, Specter DeFi facilitates its users to lend their Near coins to others and borrow it from the protocol pool.
In exchange, the lender gets interest payments. Specter DeFi operates without any middlemen, hence, the financial rewards are sent straight away to the users. The best thing about using Specter DeFi is that the users don’t ever need to disclose their identity, and still borrow or lend Near coins.

### `How does Specter DeFi  work?`
1. Lending:
The lender sends a lending request to the smart contract and then those funds get stored in the blockchain with the contract. When the lender wishes to withdraw his funds, he can send a withdrawal request to the contract and receive the funds with the interest rewards.
2. Borrowing:
The borrowers send a borrow request to the smart contract and those funds are transferred to the user in return. The user can repay the funds by sending a repay request, but this time the user would also have to provide the payment with the interest added.
Note: Since this is still an in-development project, we do not take any collateral, when providing funds to the borrow, this would be added in the future.
